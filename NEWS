- Added GBLassoFV and GBRidgeFV for generalized bayesian lasso and ridge regression with fixed variance.
- Fixed SBLassoISq, SBLassoRSq, SBRidgeISq, SBLassoRSq; omitted to sample the mean in the previous version.
- Changed rinvgauss from SuppDists (copied because orphaned) not using NO_C_HEADERS anymore. 
- \dontrun{} for all SafeBayes examples in documentation, because the examples take too much time on CRAN servers.
